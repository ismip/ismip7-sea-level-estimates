## Jupyter Notebook

The most capable tool is Jupyter Lab (https://theghub.org/resources/4913)
If you get an error on launch, just clear the workspace.

On the left you can navigate the directory structure and double click a notebook file of your choice.
If you get asked, choose the Python3 (ICESHEET) kernel.

You can also fire up a Terminal to make links, copy files and the like.
It was recommended to link the project into your home so you can have easy access.    

```
user@theghub-xyz:~$ cd
user@theghub-yxz:~$ mkdir projects/
user@theghub-xyz:~$ cd projects/
user@theghub-xyz:~/projects$ ln -s /data/projects/ismip7sealvel ./
```
